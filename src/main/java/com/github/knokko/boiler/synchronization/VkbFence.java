/**
 * A fat wrapper around a <i>VkFence</i>. This class stores extra state to make the fence more powerful:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>You can also 'signal' it from the host (using the <i>signal()</i> method)</li>
 *     <li>
 *         You can use pass an instance of this class to the <i>FenceSubmission</i> constructor. You can safely await
 *         this fence submission, even after this fence has been awaited and reset, and even after it has been returned
 *         to the bank.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Calling the instance methods of this class typically requires lesser code than calling the
 *         corresponding Vulkan functions.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * You should <b>not</b> create instances of this class yourself: you should borrow them from
 * <i>boilerInstance.sync.fenceBank</i>.
